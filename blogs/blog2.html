      <h1>My take on neoG.</h1>
      <p>I'm pretty sure if you are here, there is no chance you don't know what is neog. But still if you don't know. Let me tell you very simply. It's an initiative by <a style = "text-decoration: none;" href = "https://tanaypratap.com/">Tanay Pratap</a></p>
      <p>Basically neog doesn't care what's your age, where you are from and what you did till date. If you are hungry to learn and improve your skillset exponentially, this is the best place.</p>
      <h2>But wait! Is it that simple?</h2>
      <p>neoG is not easy obviously. How do I know this even before joining? Because it's not pay and take the course. Your hunger and grit to learn is tested even before you get into neoG. </p>
      <h2>levelOne is paid bootcamp. Now why is it paid?</h2>
      <p> Because I personally feel it is the fine we are paying on us for not being a self-taught programmer till now and it's completely fine. I personally wasted my parents' money entering into a Tier-3 college by paying donation. </p>
      <h2>Does Tanay teach any Ninja technique of becoming a self-taught programmer?</h2>
      <p>I can't answer this accurately. But the community he's trying to build is not just like another community. It's a family. Don't believe me. Go check out the <a  style = "text-decoration: none;" href = "https://discord.com/invite/qaGwEEB8eF">Discord server. </a>Here you find like minded people, highly skilled people than you, more important than that, most helpful people, no matter if you are a noob or pro. So that community itself is a driving force for you to push your limits forward. It's complete online bootcamp. But just imagine if it was offline what would be the amount of transformation we'd be going through if we could interact personally with all the neoGrammars. After levelOne you are no noob or beginner. You already had the soup to increase your hunger ðŸ˜€</p>
      <h2>Should you do it only to get a highly paying job?</h2>
      <p>No. But why? I understand the intention of the ones who try to join this camp is ultimately to get a great paying job. But that's not just the intention. Ofcourse it is a part of your journey with neoG. But that doesn't mean that it will be like the Training & Placement Cell of a college. As I said you see hungry people, or for that matter starving animals at neoGðŸ˜œ.</p>
      <h2>Can't I do it myself?</h2>
      <p>Yes you can. Even the roadmap for levelOne is an open route for anyone. But I am sure again the ones who are here might have been in the tutorial hell just like me. We feel like we are learning by split screen - code copying from a tutorial. After a month if you visit that code, it might not be easily understood by you. That brain muscule nurturing is going to be in neoG.</p>
      <h2>Sharath, aren't you talking a bit over confidently? Don't you see any con in this bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>Honestly I couldn't be happier after coming across neoG. I used to follow Tanay on Linkedin from few months. But only I have came across this beauty like a month ago. And Boom!!! My projects are done. Well my confidence is simple. I needed a teacher in my life who doesn't put great efforts to grab your attention and rule your mind with the way he talks. Tanay is one of that kinda guy. He is an awesome teacher, and the way he explains complex things by breaking them down to smaller chunks. So I'm already connected. Just a couple of YouTube's pre-recorded streams made me this excited. Can't wait to learn from him live at levelOne. And no cons found as of now.</p>
      <h2>This is the phase of my life where I'm quitting the most poisonous habbit.</h2>
      <p>Spoon feeding. I never could crack a FAANG level interviews. I work in a service based company whose interview standards were okayish for a person like me to get a job. I don't hope to get into FAANG after neoG. I want to show what's my worth to any company out there after graduating as neoGrammar. I promise this portfolio is going to be much advanced in terms of UI/UX in coming couple of months.</p>

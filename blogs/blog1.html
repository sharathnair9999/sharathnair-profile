    <h1>How it all started?</h1>
    <p>I was listening a podcast on YouTube that was featuring <strong>Jay Shetty</strong>. He spoke about how being a party person and a carefree soul and then converting into a monk by drawing inspiration from Gauranga Das on how life functions. He also had a wide perspective about love and relationships. I mainly draw inspiration from him about the way he preaches and makes people understand how being spiritual and deep-diving into your soul would bring out the maximum potential out from a person. Breathe work is the one thing among many others he focusses and stresses a lot about</p>
    <br>
    <p>And then I started reading his book <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Think-Like-Monk-Jay-Shetty/dp/0008386595" style ="text-decoration: none;">Think like a monk</a>. This book is something that I closely felt like listening to Bhagwad Gita. How contaminated are we actually inside ourselves with very unrealistic goals and behaviour in and around us and so many questions that should be pondering in our mind but they never do. There is no specific page or chapter that I can suggest you to read. You open a random page and you'll find some unique or undiscovered thing by you till date. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I am very amateur at meditation and breathe work. But I slowly started making it into occasional activity from rare. Soon it will become part of my life.</p>
    <h3>Hope you enjoyed reading this short blog about spirituality path that I'm into</h3>
